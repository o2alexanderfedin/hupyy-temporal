In other words, it is an independent constraint, not a consequence of the other facts.\n\nTo demonstrate this, let's consider a possible timeline where the other rules are met, but this one is not:\n\n1.  Let's say milestone **A‚ÇÅ** finishes at time `t=0` minutes.\n2.  The rule \"B‚ÇÇ cannot start until 45 minutes after A‚ÇÅ ends\" means **B‚ÇÇ** can start at `t=45` or later. Let's say it starts exactly at `t=45`.\n3.  The rule \"A‚ÇÇ finishes before B‚ÇÇ begins\" is met. For example, **A‚ÇÇ** could finish at `t=30`.\n4.  From the project sequences, we know **A‚ÇÉ** can start any time after A‚ÇÇ finishes (so, after `t=30`). Let's say it starts at `t=31`.\n5.  We also know **B‚ÇÉ** can start any time after B‚ÇÇ finishes. We don't know the duration of B‚ÇÇ. Let's assume B‚ÇÇ is a very short milestone that takes only 5 minutes. It would finish at `t=50`, so **B‚ÇÉ** could start at `t=50`.\n\nNow, let's check the condition in question. A‚ÇÉ started at `t=31`. We have no information about how long A‚ÇÉ takes.\n\n* If A‚ÇÉ takes 10 minutes, it finishes at `t=41`. In this case, it *does* finish before B‚ÇÉ starts (`41 < 50`).\n* However, if A‚ÇÉ is a long milestone and takes 25 minutes, it finishes at `t=56` (`31 + 25`). In this case, it finishes *after* B‚ÇÉ starts (`56 > 50`).\n\nSince we can create a valid scenario where A‚ÇÉ does *not* finish before B‚ÇÉ starts, the statement \"A‚ÇÉ finishes before B‚ÇÉ begins\" is not a logical consequence of the other rules. It is only true because it was given as a fact.",
