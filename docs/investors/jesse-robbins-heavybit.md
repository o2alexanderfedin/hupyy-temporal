**Opening Hook:**
"At Amazon, you created GameDay to prevent infrastructure failures through chaos engineering. We're bringing that same rigor to data pipelines. Every company building AI products faces the same problem you solved for infrastructure: how do you know your data is reliable before it reaches production?"

**Problem Framing:**
"Data teams today are where infrastructure teams were in 2008 before Chef. Manual testing, brittle pipelines, production incidents. The DevOps movement you helped create taught us that automation, testing, and continuous delivery are critical. But those practices haven't reached data pipelines yet."

**Why Now:**
"AI is forcing this issue. Companies are making million-dollar decisions based on data pipelines they don't trust. Just as cloud infrastructure required DevOps practices, AI infrastructure requires data reliability practices. The data reliability market is having its DevOps moment - right now."

**Heavybit Fit:**
"We're technical founders from [backgrounds] building developer-first infrastructure. We need Heavybit's expertise in the community-to-enterprise transition. And given your chaos engineering background and recent investments in data observability (Recce), we believe you uniquely understand this problem space."

**Call to Action:**
"We're raising [X] to build the category-defining data reliability platform. We'd love Heavybit to lead this round and help us navigate the GTM strategy you've successfully guided for LaunchDarkly, PagerDuty, and others."

### Competitive Positioning vs. Portfolio

**Potential Overlap:**
- Recce (data observability)
- Avo (analytics governance)
- Groundcover (observability)

**Differentiation Strategy:**
- Complementary, not competitive: "We're the temporal data layer beneath observability"
- Different problem space: "Reliability before observability"
- Integration opportunity: "We'd be natural partners with Recce and Groundcover"
- Category adjacency: "Same market, different swim lane"

**Portfolio Synergies:**
- Integrations with CircleCI (data pipeline CI/CD)
- Complement Snyk (data security and quality)
- Partner with Sanity (content as data, data as content)
- Support PagerDuty users (data incidents are incidents)

### Meeting Success Criteria

**You'll Know the Meeting Went Well If:**
- Jesse asks about technical architecture and reliability
- Discussion centers on GTM timing and community strategy
- He connects you with portfolio company founders
- Follow-up meeting scheduled with other Heavybit partners
- He offers to intro you to relevant advisors or customers

**Red Flags During Meeting:**
- Questions focus on market size without product interest
- Lack of engagement with technical details
- No follow-up questions or discussion
- Meeting ends early
- Generic feedback without specific insights

### Post-Meeting Follow-Up

**Within 24 Hours:**
- Thank you email with summary of discussion
- Any requested materials or data
- Link to demo, GitHub, community channels
- Propose specific next steps with timeline

**Ongoing Engagement:**
- Monthly updates on key metrics (community growth, design partners)
- Share relevant industry insights or research
- Engage with Heavybit content and community
- Facilitate intros with potential portfolio fits

### Fallback Options if Not a Fit

**Why It Might Not Work:**
- Too early (no community traction yet)
- Market timing concerns (data reliability not mature enough)
- Portfolio overlap (too similar to Recce)
- Stage mismatch (too early or too late)

**Alternative Heavybit Partners:**
- Dana Oshiro (Co-founder, General Partner) - Content infrastructure focus
- Joe Floyd (Partner) - Enterprise infrastructure
- James Lindenbaum (Venture Partner) - Heroku founder, dev tools expert

**Adjacent Investors to Consider:**
- **Accel** (LaunchDarkly, Sumo Logic) - Developer tools focus
- **Amplify Partners** (infrastructure-first investing)
- **CRV** (Snyk, PagerDuty investors) - Enterprise dev tools
- **Redpoint** (Snowflake, dbt) - Data infrastructure
- **Work-Bench** (enterprise infrastructure, NYC-based)
