## Executive Summary

**5 Key Insights for Pitching Hetz Ventures:**

1. **Israeli-Only Focus with 20-Day Decision Speed**: Hetz exclusively invests in Israeli startups but moves exceptionally fast - averaging 20 days from first meeting to term sheet. They lead 85% of their seed rounds, so they're decisive and commit fully when interested.

2. **Thesis-Driven Top-Down Approach (70% Proactive)**: Unlike reactive VCs, Hetz identifies market gaps first, then finds startups to fill them. 70% of their portfolio comes from proactive sourcing. They deeply understand their focus verticals and expect founders to demonstrate strategic market positioning.

3. **Technical Depth is Non-Negotiable**: With partners from IDF intelligence, hedge fund data leadership, and deep DevOps/observability backgrounds (Guy Fighel from New Relic/SignifAI), they expect technical sophistication. Their Data Program (SPARQL) and repoInspector tool show hands-on technical engagement.

4. **Developer Tools & Infrastructure Sweet Spot**: Core focus on DevOps, developer productivity, data infrastructure, and cybersecurity. Recent exits include Granulate to Intel ($650M), Silk Security to Armis ($150M), and Seekret to Datadog ($70M) - all infrastructure/security plays.

5. **Pragmatic Value Philosophy**: Post-2022 market shift, Judah Taub publicly told founders to "come to terms with reality" on valuations. They prioritize capital efficiency, ability to pivot, and fundamental performance over growth-at-all-costs. Don't pitch inflated valuations or unrealistic projections.

## What Resonates with Hetz Ventures

### Pitch Recommendations

#### **1. Lead with Technical Depth & Market Gap**

**DO:**
- Start with the specific market gap you identified through deep domain expertise
- Demonstrate technical sophistication (they have data scientists, DevOps veterans, IDF intelligence)
- Show you understand competitive landscape and why existing solutions fail
- Reference their thesis-driven approach: "This aligns with your focus on X"

**DON'T:**
- Pitch as "better than X" - they want category creation
- Oversimplify technical challenges
- Ignore open source precedents if relevant to your space
- Claim "no competitors" (they do deep market analysis)

**Example Opening:**
"We identified a critical gap in [specific technical domain] through our work at [credible company]. Current solutions like [competitor] fail because [technical reason]. We're building the first [category] purpose-built for [emerging use case]."

#### **2. Demonstrate Founder-Market Fit (Israeli Context)**

**DO:**
- Highlight relevant IDF experience (especially intelligence, R&D units)
- Showcase previous startups, exits, or scale-up experience
- Demonstrate technical credibility (publications, open source contributions, community standing)
- Show understanding of Israeli tech ecosystem and global markets

**DON'T:**
- Lead with business degrees over technical credentials
- Ignore the "builder's DNA" they explicitly seek
- Underestimate the importance of technical founding teams
- Pitch as solo non-technical founder without strong CTO

**Example:**
"I led data infrastructure at [scale-up that grew X→Y] and saw this problem firsthand. My co-founder built the distributed systems team at [credible Israeli tech company]. We've contributed to [OSS project] with 10K+ stars."

#### **3. Present Realistic Valuation & Capital Strategy**

**DO:**
- Show awareness of 2022+ market reality
- Present capital-efficient roadmap
- Demonstrate clear path to next milestones with current round
- Reference comparable recent seed rounds in your space

**DON'T:**
- Pitch 2021-era valuations
- Present "growth at all costs" mentality
- Ignore unit economics or path to profitability
- Ask for 18-24 month runway with unclear milestones

**Judah Taub's Guidance:**
- "Figure out your valuation in today's market"
- "Come to terms with reality"
- They look for capital efficiency and ability to pivot

**Example:**
"We're raising $5M at a $20M post-money valuation, in line with recent [comparable] rounds. This gives us 24 months to reach $2M ARR and Series A metrics. Our burn is $200K/month, all going to engineering and first enterprise customers."

#### **4. Show Developer/Community Traction (If Applicable)**

**DO:**
- Present real usage metrics (not just GitHub stars)
- Use their framework: standalone metrics, benchmarks, community, monetization
- Show active users vs. total users
- Demonstrate engagement (forks, PRs, issues, Discord activity)

**DON'T:**
- Lead with vanity metrics (stars, followers without engagement)
- Claim traction without showing conversion to revenue
- Ignore their open source evaluation framework (they literally built repoInspector)

**repoInspector Framework:**
1. **Standalone Metrics:** Stars (awareness), Forks/Docker pulls (usage), Issues/PRs (contribution)
2. **Benchmarks:** How you compare to similar projects in ecosystem
3. **Community:** Discord, Slack, Reddit, Twitter beyond GitHub
4. **Monetization:** Path from OSS to revenue (support, managed service, open-core, dual-license)

**Example:**
"We have 5K GitHub stars with 800 active forks in production use. Our Discord has 2K members with 500 DAU. We're converting 5% to our managed service at $50K ACV, with 6 design partners signed."

#### **5. Articulate Clear Go-to-Market Strategy**

**DO:**
- Show understanding of product-led growth (if applicable)
- Demonstrate first enterprise/design partner traction
- Explain bottoms-up adoption within enterprises
- Show how you'll scale from community to revenue

**DON'T:**
- Present generic "we'll do content marketing" GTM
- Ignore developer experience and developer relations
- Underestimate enterprise sales complexity
- Pitch consumer business models

**Pavel Livshiz's Emphasis:**
- VCs should help with "hiring top talent" and "valuable advice" on GTM
- Hetz provides "go-to-market strategy and product-market fit development"

**Example:**
"We're product-led with freemium model. Developers adopt via npm/Docker, then we engage engineering leaders for team plans at $50K-$200K. We have 6 design partners including [credible logos], 3 converting to paid in Q1. Our first sales hire will be Q2 once we prove repeatability."

#### **6. Demonstrate Ability to Pivot**

**DO:**
- Share examples of customer feedback changing your roadmap
- Show hypothesis testing and iteration
- Acknowledge what you don't know yet
- Present roadmap as thesis to validate, not set-in-stone plan

**DON'T:**
- Present overly rigid 3-year plan
- Ignore market feedback or early customer insights
- Defend failing approaches
- Show stubbornness or inability to adapt

**Pavel Livshiz Quote:**
"Ability to pivot is what we look for in startups"

**Example:**
"We initially built for [use case A], but early customers pushed us toward [use case B]. We validated this with 10 interviews and rebuilt our MVP in 6 weeks. Now 80% of interest is [use case B], so we're pivoting fully while keeping [use case A] as secondary."

   - Foundational AI infrastructure, not applications
   - MLOps, LLMOps, model observability
   - AI security and governance

### Red Flags & Deal Breakers

**Based on Public Statements and Portfolio Patterns:**

1. **Unrealistic Valuations**
   - Judah explicitly warned against overvaluation in 2022
   - Post-2022, they expect realistic pricing
   - "Figure out your valuation in today's market"

2. **Non-Israeli Founders**
   - 100% of portfolio is Israeli
   - Don't pitch if you're not Israeli-based
   - This is a hard geographic filter

3. **Consumer or Application-Layer Only**
   - Portfolio is almost entirely B2B infrastructure
   - No consumer apps, marketplaces, or DTC brands
   - Must be technical infrastructure or enterprise SaaS

4. **Lack of Technical Depth**
   - Non-technical solo founders unlikely to succeed
   - No technical moat or differentiation
   - "Better UX" without technical innovation

5. **Inability to Articulate Market Gap**
   - They're thesis-driven and expect you to articulate the "why now"
   - Can't just be "Competitor X but better"
   - Need to explain structural market change

6. **No Community or Early Traction**
   - For developer tools: need GitHub stars, community engagement
   - For enterprise: need design partners or LOIs
   - Can't be pure PowerPoint at seed stage

- Larger checks and fund size
- More lead-investor positioning
- Faster decision-making
- Thesis-driven vs. community-driven sourcing
- Broader verticals (includes cyber, fintech, not just dev tools)

**Choose Hetz Over Heavybit If:**
- You're an Israeli startup (geographic requirement)
- You need a lead investor with $3M+ check
- You want faster decision (20 days vs. 60-90)
- You need executive network in data/AI/cyber specifically
- You fit their thesis-driven investment themes

**Choose Heavybit Over Hetz If:**
- You're US/global (not Israeli)
- You need smaller checks ($500K-$1M)
- You want deep community engagement and content platform
- You're very early (pre-product, pre-traction)
- Pure developer tools focus (not cyber/fintech)

### Complementary or Competitive?

**Potentially Complementary:**
- If you're Israeli startup raising from US investors, could have both
- Hetz as lead, Heavybit as strategic co-investor for US GTM
- Example: No current co-investments in public data, but not mutually exclusive

**Competitive For:**
- Israeli developer tools startups deciding on lead investor
- Rounds where both are interested (Hetz likely more aggressive on terms/speed)

### Questions to Ask Them

1. **Portfolio Fit:**

   - "How do you see us complementing your existing portfolio vs. competing with any investments?"

2. **Value-Add:**
   - "For a company at our stage in [vertical], what are the typical growth challenges you see, and how does Hetz help?"
   - "Can you share an example of a portfolio company you helped with [specific challenge we face]?"
   - "How does the Data Program / Executive Network work for portfolio companies?"

3. **Investment Process:**
   - "What are the next steps in your diligence process?"
   - "What's your typical timeline from now to term sheet?" (They say 20 days - test this)
   - "Are there specific technical or market questions you want us to prepare for?"

4. **Follow-On Support:**
   - "How do you think about reserves and follow-on through the Opportunity Fund?"
   - "What does Series A readiness look like in [our vertical] in today's market?"

### Red Flags to Avoid in Your Pitch

1. **Don't Say:**
   - "We're the Uber of X" (consumer analogy)
   - "We have no competitors" (they do deep market analysis)
   - "We'll figure out monetization later" (they want clear path)
   - "We need to raise at 2021 valuations because..." (ignore Judah's advice)
   - "We're not sure about the Israeli market, we're focused on US" (wrong fund)

2. **Don't Do:**
   - Show up with only slides, no demo or live product
   - Present top-down market sizing ("$500B market, we'll get 1%")
   - Ignore open source competitors or precedents
   - Pitch without knowing their portfolio
   - Be evasive about challenges or competition

3. **Don't Be:**
   - Slow to respond (they move in 20 days, you need to match pace)
   - Unprepared for technical questions
   - Rigid about your approach (they value ability to pivot)
   - Unrealistic about valuation or market conditions
