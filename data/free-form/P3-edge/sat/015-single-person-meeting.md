# One Person Meeting

I need to schedule a "meeting" with myself. Like a focus time block where I work on this proposal alone.

Most meeting software is built around the idea of multiple people - you've got attendees, you're coordinating schedules, finding times that work for everyone. But this is just me. One person. Solo.

The constraints are:
- Meeting has 1 attendee (me)
- Duration is 2 hours
- Happens sometime on Tuesday between 9am and 5pm
- No conflicts with my other commitments

The edge case is that meetings usually imply multiple people. The word "meeting" suggests coming together with others. But here we have a meeting with cardinality of 1. Just a single participant.

It's like when you put a calendar block called "meeting" but you're the only attendee. Some systems get confused by this - they expect at least 2 people for it to be a "meeting." Others call it something different like "appointment" or "event" when it's just one person.

Can you schedule a meeting with a participant count of 1? Or does the scheduling logic assume meetings have at least 2 attendees?
