# Backyard Party with No Rules

I'm throwing this super casual backyard party and honestly there are no rules or constraints.

People can show up whenever. Leave whenever. Bring food or don't. Bring friends or come alone. Whatever.

The "constraints" are:
- Party happens sometime on Saturday
- (that's it)

There's no required start time, no required end time, no guest list, no RSVP, no schedule. Just "party on Saturday, come if you want."

This is an edge case because scheduling problems usually have constraints - that's what makes them problems. You need to satisfy certain requirements or relationships between events.

But this party has zero constraints beyond "exists on Saturday." It's not even "must be at night" or "must be at least 2 hours long." Just... party. Saturday. Done.

Can a scheduling system handle something with basically no constraints? Like, does it need at least some relationships or requirements to work with? Or can it just say "ok, party at time T on Saturday" where T can be literally anything?

It's the minimum possible scheduling problem - one event, no constraints.

Logic: QF_IDL
