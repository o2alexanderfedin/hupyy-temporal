# Conference Keynote Conflict

I got invited to give keynote talks at two conferences and I really want to do both. But there's this scheduling problem.

Conference A is in San Francisco, keynote is Tuesday at 10am Pacific time. The talk is 1 hour long, but with Q&A and networking it's more like 10am-12pm that I need to be there.

Conference B is in New York, keynote is Tuesday at 1pm Eastern time. That's also 10am Pacific time. Same exact time window - I need to be in New York from 10am-12pm Pacific (which is 1pm-3pm Eastern).

So the constraints are:
- Be in San Francisco from 10am-12pm Pacific on Tuesday
- Be in New York from 10am-12pm Pacific on Tuesday (1pm-3pm Eastern)
- Travel time San Francisco to New York is like 5-6 hours

The edge case here is physical impossibility. Even if I left SF at 10am, I couldn't be in NY by 10am same day. I'd need to arrive before I left. The time windows overlap completely and the locations are 3000 miles apart.

It's not like "this is a tight schedule" or "this will be hard to arrange." The travel time makes it physically impossible to be in both places during overlapping time windows.

Logic: QF_IDL
