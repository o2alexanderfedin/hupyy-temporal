# After Hours Building Badge Access

Karen works in operations, been with the company about a year. She's got a regular employee badge for building access, nothing special about her access level.

The office building has time-based access control. Everyone's badge is programmed with specific hours when it works. For most regular employees, the badges are active from 6am to 8pm on weekdays. That covers normal business hours plus some buffer time for people who come in early or stay late.

Karen left her laptop at the office and realizes she needs it for an early morning meeting tomorrow. It's currently 11pm on a Tuesday night. She drives over to the office to grab it real quick.

Her badge is configured with the standard employee access schedule, which is 6am to 8pm. The building door readers check both the badge permissions and the time window. It's 11pm right now, which is 3 hours after her badge access window ends.

Karen is standing at the building entrance at 11pm. Her badge works during 6am-8pm. The current time is outside that window.

Can Karen use her badge to enter the building at 11pm?
