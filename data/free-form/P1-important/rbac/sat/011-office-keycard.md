# Office Building Keycard Access

So Sarah works at this company as a full-time software engineer. She's been there for like 2 years now, definitely not a contractor or anything temporary.

The office building has keycard access. The way it works is all full-time employees get a keycard that lets them into the main building. That's the ground floor entrance, the lobby area, all that.

Sarah's team sits on the 3rd floor, and she needs to get to her desk obviously. The 3rd floor is set up so that anyone who can access the main building can also access floors 1-3. Floors 4 and up are for executives and require special access.

So Sarah has the full-time employee role. That role grants building access to the main entrance. Building access also includes floors 1-3 by default. The 3rd floor is where Sarah needs to go.

Can Sarah get to her desk on the 3rd floor with her keycard?
