# Marketing Shared Drive Folder

Tom just started in the marketing department about 3 months ago. He's part of the marketing team, reports to the marketing director, all the usual stuff.

The company has this shared network drive at /shared where all the departments keep their files. There's /shared/marketing, /shared/sales, /shared/hr, you get the idea.

The marketing folder at /shared/marketing is where the team keeps all their campaign materials, social media schedules, brand assets, things like that. Tom needs to update some files in there for the spring campaign he's working on.

The permissions are set up so that anyone who's on the marketing team has edit access to the /shared/marketing folder. Like they can create files, modify existing ones, delete stuff if needed. Other departments can maybe view it but not edit.

Tom is definitely assigned to the marketing team in the system. The marketing team role has edit permissions for /shared/marketing. Tom wants to update the spring campaign doc that's sitting in that folder.

Can Tom modify files in the /shared/marketing folder?

Logic: QF_UFLIA
