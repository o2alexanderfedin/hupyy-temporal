# Manager Expense Approval Authority

David manages the customer success team, about 8 people report to him. He's been a manager at the company for around 18 months now, came up through the ranks.

The company uses this expense management system where employees submit expenses and they go through an approval workflow. Things like conference tickets, software subscriptions, travel costs, client dinners, all that.

The approval rules are tiered based on the amount. Small stuff under like $500 goes through automatically. Anything bigger needs manager approval. Really big purchases over $5000 have to go up to the director level or finance.

David has the manager role in the system. Managers are allowed to approve expense requests that are under $5000. Anything at $5000 or above kicks up to the next level, but below that threshold managers can sign off.

One of David's team members just submitted an expense for $3200. It's for a customer success platform subscription they need for the next quarter. The expense is sitting in the approval queue assigned to David.

Can David approve this $3200 expense request?
