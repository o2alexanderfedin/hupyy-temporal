# Manager Vacation Approval Policy Verification

This company has an HR policy that states all managers must approve or deny vacation requests within 2 business days. That's the official policy in the employee handbook - EVERY manager, for ANY vacation request, must respond within 48 hours.

We've got the HR system data showing vacation requests submitted to managers and how long it took to get a response. Here's what we see:
- Request 201 to Manager Smith: responded in 24 hours
- Request 202 to Manager Johnson: responded in 36 hours
- Request 203 to Manager Williams: responded in 18 hours
- Request 204 to Manager Smith: responded in 42 hours
- Request 205 to Manager Brown: responded in 30 hours
- Request 206 to Manager Davis: responded in 12 hours
- Request 207 to Manager Johnson: responded in 48 hours
- Request 208 to Manager Martinez: responded in 6 hours
- Request 209 to Manager Williams: responded in 40 hours
- Request 210 to Manager Brown: responded in 15 hours

The universal policy claim is: for any vacation request X submitted to any manager, the approval response time is at most 48 hours.

We can see these specific requests were all handled within the policy timeframe. But does this policy actually hold across the entire organization? Not just for these 10 requests, but for literally every vacation request submitted to every manager in the company?

This is challenging because we're evaluating a universal organizational policy (applies to all managers and all requests) based on a sample of observed cases. The question is whether these examples are enough to verify the universal claim or if there's inherent uncertainty.

Logic: UFLIA (with quantifiers)
