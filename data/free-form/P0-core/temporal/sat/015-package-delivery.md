# Tracking My Package Delivery

I ordered something online and I'm trying to track when it's going to actually arrive because I need to be home to sign for it. Let me walk through the whole delivery timeline based on what the tracking info is telling me.

So I placed my order on Monday morning at 9:00am. The website said it would ship within 24 hours of ordering.

The package actually shipped out from their warehouse on Tuesday at 8:00am. So that was 23 hours after I placed the order - they got it out pretty quick.

Once it shipped, it went to a regional shipping hub. According to the tracking, the package arrived at the hub on Wednesday at 2:00pm. That was 30 hours after it left the warehouse.

From the regional hub, packages get sorted and then sent out to local distribution centers. My package left the regional hub on Wednesday at 6:00pm and arrived at my local distribution center on Thursday at 10:00am. That leg took 16 hours.

Now here's the final stretch. Packages that arrive at my local distribution center in the morning get loaded onto delivery trucks and go out for delivery that same day. The delivery truck left the distribution center at 11:00am on Thursday.

The driver has a bunch of stops to make before mine, so my package isn't coming first thing. Based on my address and where I am on the route, my estimated delivery window is between 2:00pm and 4:00pm on Thursday.

Let me trace the whole timeline: Order placed Monday 9:00am, package ships Tuesday 8:00am (23 hours later), arrives at regional hub Wednesday 2:00pm (30 hours after shipping), leaves regional hub Wednesday 6:00pm (4 hours at hub), arrives at local center Thursday 10:00am (16 hours in transit), loaded on truck Thursday 11:00am (1 hour at local center), delivery window starts Thursday 2:00pm (3 hours after truck leaves).

I'm trying to figure out if all these timing windows make sense and if I'm reading the tracking info correctly. Like is it realistic for the package to arrive at my door during that 2-4pm window on Thursday given all these steps?
