# Movie Night Plans

My friend and I are going to see a movie tonight and I'm trying to plan out the whole evening to make sure we're not rushing around stressed.

So we're planning to grab dinner first before the movie. There's this really good Thai place near the theater that we love. We're meeting there at 6:00pm.

When we get to the restaurant, we usually have to wait a few minutes for a table even with a reservation. Then there's ordering, getting our food, eating, paying the bill - the whole restaurant experience. Based on past times we've been there, from when we walk in the door to when we're walking out takes about 55 minutes.

After dinner we need to walk to the movie theater. It's literally just down the block, like a 5-minute walk. Super convenient which is why we picked that restaurant.

The movie starts at 8:00pm and we want to be there early enough to get good seats and maybe grab some popcorn. I'm thinking we need to be at the theater by 7:30pm to have enough time to get tickets, snacks, find our seats, and see the previews.

The movie itself is 2 hours and 15 minutes long. So it'll end at 10:15pm.

After the movie ends, we're going to walk back to where we parked our cars. We both parked in the same garage near the restaurant, which is about a 10-minute walk from the theater.

Then we're going our separate ways - I'm driving home and she's driving to her place. My drive home takes about 30 minutes at that time of night.

Here's my timeline: Meet at restaurant at 6:00pm, finish dinner by 6:55pm, walk to theater (6:55-7:00pm), we're there by 7:00pm which gives us 30 minutes before the 7:30pm target time. Wait, let me recalculate - if the movie starts at 8:00pm and we want to be there by 7:30pm, and we walk from 6:55-7:00pm, that means we're there at 7:00pm which is actually 30 minutes before our target. Then movie starts at 8:00pm, ends at 10:15pm, walk to garage (10:15-10:25pm), drive home (10:25-10:55pm).

I'm trying to figure out if this all flows smoothly or if we need to adjust our dinner reservation time. Like will we have enough time to eat without feeling rushed, and will we get to the theater with enough cushion time?
