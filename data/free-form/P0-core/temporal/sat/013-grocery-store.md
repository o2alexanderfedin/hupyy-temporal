# Weekly Grocery Shopping Trip

I need to do my weekly grocery run today and I'm trying to plan out how long this whole thing is going to take because I've got a Zoom call at 4:00pm that I absolutely cannot miss.

So here's how my grocery trips usually go. First I need to drive to the store. There's a Trader Joe's about 15 minutes from my apartment, and that's where I'm heading. I'm leaving my apartment at 2:00pm.

When I get to the store, I usually spend some time actually shopping - walking through the aisles, checking my list, comparing prices, sometimes browsing for stuff I didn't know I needed but suddenly realize I can't live without. Realistically I spend about 40 minutes in the store from when I walk in the door to when I'm standing in the checkout line.

Then there's the checkout process. On a Saturday afternoon like today, the lines can be a bit long. I'd say from getting in line to having all my bags in the cart and walking out of the store takes about 15 minutes.

After that I need to drive back home. Same route, so another 15 minutes.

And then the part I always underestimate - unloading the car and putting away all the groceries. I've got to make multiple trips from the car to my apartment, put everything away in the right spots, refrigerate the cold stuff, organize the pantry a bit. This whole process takes me about 25 minutes from when I park the car to when the last can of beans is in the cabinet.

So let me map this out: Leave apartment at 2:00pm, drive to store (2:00-2:15pm), shop (2:15-2:55pm), checkout (2:55-3:10pm), drive home (3:10-3:25pm), unload and put away groceries (3:25-3:50pm).

That means I'd be done at 3:50pm and my Zoom call is at 4:00pm. That's a 10-minute buffer which feels tight but maybe doable? I need to figure out if this timing makes sense or if I need to reschedule my call.
