# Getting Ready in the Morning

This is literally my exact morning routine every weekday and I'm always wondering if I'm cutting it too close on time or if I'm actually fine.

So I wake up at 6:30am when my alarm goes off. The very first thing I do is go take a shower. I'm not a super long shower person but I'm also not one of those people who's in and out in 3 minutes. I'd say I spend a solid 12 minutes in the shower from when I turn the water on to when I step out.

After I shower, I need to get dressed. I usually lay out my clothes the night before so I'm not standing in front of my closet for 20 minutes trying to decide what to wear. Getting dressed, including drying off and putting on lotion and all that stuff, takes me about 8 minutes.

Once I'm dressed, I go to the kitchen and make myself breakfast. Nothing fancy - usually just scrambled eggs and toast, maybe some fruit. From walking into the kitchen to sitting down with my plate takes about 15 minutes.

Then I actually eat my breakfast. I like to eat slowly and scroll through the news on my phone, not rush through it. I give myself 20 minutes to eat.

After breakfast, I brush my teeth. This is non-negotiable and has to happen after I eat, not before. Brushing teeth, flossing, using mouthwash, the whole dental hygiene routine takes me about 6 minutes.

And then I need to be out the door by 7:45am to catch my bus to work. If I miss that bus I have to wait another 20 minutes for the next one and then I'm late.

So my timeline is: alarm at 6:30am, shower from 6:30-6:42am, get dressed from 6:42-6:50am, make breakfast from 6:50-7:05am, eat breakfast from 7:05-7:25am, brush teeth from 7:25-7:31am, and then out the door by 7:45am.

That leaves me about 14 minutes between finishing my teeth routine and leaving. I usually use that time to grab my bag, check I have everything, maybe look at my calendar for the day.

Does this all work out time-wise? Am I giving myself enough time for each thing or am I going to be that person running down the street trying to catch the bus?
