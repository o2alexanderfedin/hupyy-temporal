# Cooking Dinner for Friends

So I invited some friends over for dinner tonight and I'm making this whole thing with pasta and roasted vegetables and garlic bread. I want to have everything ready by 7:00pm when people start showing up because I don't want to be that host who's still cooking when guests arrive.

Let me walk through what I need to do. First I need to prep all my vegetables - washing, chopping, seasoning, getting them on the baking sheet. That takes me about 20 minutes of active work in the kitchen.

Once the veggies are prepped, I can stick them in the oven. They need to roast for 35 minutes at 425 degrees. The good thing is once they're in the oven, I don't need to do anything with them until they're done.

While the vegetables are roasting, I can start making the pasta. I need to boil water first, which takes about 10 minutes to get to a rolling boil. Then once it's boiling, I add the pasta and it cooks for 12 minutes.

The garlic bread is pretty easy - I just need to slice the bread, spread butter and garlic on it, wrap it in foil, and pop it in the oven. That prep takes about 8 minutes. And it only needs to bake for 10 minutes.

Here's my timing plan: I'll start prepping vegetables at 5:30pm and finish by 5:50pm. Put them in the oven at 5:50pm, they'll be done at 6:25pm. While they're roasting, I'll start boiling water at 5:55pm, water boils by 6:05pm, add pasta, and it's done by 6:17pm. Then I'll prep the garlic bread starting at 6:30pm, finish prep by 6:38pm, put it in the oven at 6:38pm, and it comes out at 6:48pm.

So vegetables done at 6:25pm, pasta done at 6:17pm, garlic bread done at 6:48pm, and guests arrive at 7:00pm. That gives me about 12 minutes to plate everything and put it on the table.

Will this timeline work out? I'm trying to figure out if I've scheduled everything correctly or if I'm going to be stressed and running around when the doorbell rings.
