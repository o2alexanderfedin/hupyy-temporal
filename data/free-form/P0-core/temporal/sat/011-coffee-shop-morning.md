# Coffee Shop Morning Routine

Okay so this is basically my every single morning and I need to figure out if the timing actually works out or if I've been lying to myself about when I need to wake up.

So I wake up and the very first thing I do is stumble into the kitchen and make coffee. I'm talking like grinding the beans, boiling water, doing the whole pour-over thing because I'm apparently that person now. This whole process takes me about 8 minutes from when I walk into the kitchen to when I'm holding a hot cup of coffee.

Now here's the thing - I literally cannot function before I have my coffee. Like I need to sit there and drink it and just stare at the wall for a bit. I'm not getting dressed, I'm not checking emails, I'm just sitting there becoming a human being again. I give myself about 15 minutes for this.

After I've had my coffee and I'm actually awake, then I can start getting ready for work. Shower, get dressed, do my hair, pack my bag, all that stuff. That takes about 35 minutes on a normal day when I'm not trying on five different outfits.

Then I drive to work. My office is across town and with morning traffic it's usually about 25 minutes. Sometimes it's 20 if I'm lucky, sometimes it's 30 if there's an accident, but let's say 25 minutes on average.

And I've got this team standup meeting every morning at 9:00am sharp. My manager is really punctual about starting on time, so I need to be in the office and at my desk ready to join the call by 9:00am.

So if I lay out the timeline: wake up and walk to kitchen at 7:00am, make coffee from 7:00-7:08am, drink coffee and wake up from 7:08-7:23am, get ready for work from 7:23-7:58am, drive to work from 7:58-8:23am, and then I've got until 9:00am for the meeting.

Does this all line up time-wise? Like am I giving myself enough buffer room or do I need to start waking up earlier?
