# Double Booked Medical Appointments

Oh man, I think I really messed up my schedule today. I'm looking at my calendar and I'm pretty sure I accidentally double booked myself with two appointments and I don't know how I'm going to make both of them.

So I have a doctor's appointment today at 2:00pm. It's my annual physical and I made this appointment like three months ago. The doctor's office is about 20 minutes from my house.

When I schedule these physicals, they always block out an hour for the appointment. So I'm supposed to be there from 2:00pm to 3:00pm. And realistically, even if the doctor sees me right on time, I'm not walking out of there until at least 3:00pm, maybe even 3:10pm if they're running behind.

But then I also have a dentist appointment today. I just looked at my calendar and it's scheduled for 2:30pm. The dentist office is across town, about 25 minutes from the doctor's office.

My dentist appointment is for a cleaning, which they told me would take about an hour, so I'm supposed to be there from 2:30pm to 3:30pm.

Let me think through this. I need to be at the doctor from 2:00pm to 3:00pm. That's at one location. Then I also need to be at the dentist from 2:30pm to 3:30pm. That's at a different location that's 25 minutes away.

So from 2:30pm to 3:00pm, I'm supposed to be in two places at once? I'm supposed to be finishing up my doctor's appointment and also be at the dentist getting my teeth cleaned?

Even if my doctor's appointment somehow ended right at 2:30pm, which would be 30 minutes early and that never happens, I'd still need 25 minutes to drive to the dentist, so I wouldn't get there until 2:55pm. But I'm supposed to be there at 2:30pm.

And the doctor's appointment is supposed to last until 3:00pm anyway, so there's this whole chunk of time from 2:30pm to 3:00pm where I'm literally supposed to be in two different places at the same time.

I'm trying to figure out if there's any way to make this work or if I absolutely have to call one of these offices and reschedule. Like is there any universe where this schedule makes sense?
