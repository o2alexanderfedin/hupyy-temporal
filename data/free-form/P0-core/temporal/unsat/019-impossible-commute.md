# Running Late for Morning Meeting

I'm freaking out a little bit because I'm trying to figure out if I can make it to my morning meeting on time and the math is not looking good.

So I have this really important client meeting that starts at 9:00am sharp. It's at our downtown office and my manager specifically told me I need to be there on time because the client is super particular about punctuality.

Here's the problem. I woke up late today. Like really late. I was supposed to wake up at 6:30am but my alarm didn't go off and I woke up at 8:30am instead.

My commute to the office takes 45 minutes on a good day. But right now it's morning rush hour, so realistically it's going to take me more like 50 minutes to get there. Maybe even an hour if there's traffic on the bridge.

So let me think about this. The meeting is at 9:00am. My commute takes 50 minutes. That means I need to leave my house by 8:10am to get there on time, right?

But I just woke up at 8:30am. That's 20 minutes after I needed to leave the house.

I'm trying to get ready as fast as I can. I can skip the shower and just throw on clothes and run out the door. If I really rush, I can be out the door in maybe 10 minutes. So I could leave my house at 8:40am.

But wait, if I leave at 8:40am and the drive takes 50 minutes, I'd get to the office at 9:30am. The meeting starts at 9:00am.

Maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let me recalculate. Meeting at 9:00am. Commute is 50 minutes. I woke up at 8:30am. If I leave by 8:40am, I arrive at 9:30am.

That's 30 minutes late to a meeting that starts at 9:00am. And my manager said I have to be there on time.

Is there any way for me to actually make it to this 9:00am meeting given that I woke up at 8:30am and it takes 50 minutes to get there? Like even if I could teleport out of my house instantly right at 8:30am, I still wouldn't get there until 9:20am because of the commute time.

I think I might need to call my manager and tell them I'm going to be late, but I'm trying to figure out if there's any scenario where I can actually be on time.
