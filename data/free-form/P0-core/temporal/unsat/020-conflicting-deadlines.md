# Impossible Work Deadlines Today

I'm in a bit of a panic right now because I'm looking at my task list for today and I don't think there's physically enough time to get everything done that needs to be done.

My manager just dropped two urgent tasks on me this morning and they both need to be completed before end of day today. It's currently 1:00pm and I need to have both of these done by 6:00pm when the office closes.

The first task is reviewing and updating this huge spreadsheet of customer data. I need to go through each row, verify the information, make corrections where needed, and add notes. I've done this kind of work before and it takes about 3 hours of focused, uninterrupted time. Like I can't really do it in smaller chunks because I need to maintain context about what I'm looking at.

The second task is writing a detailed report about last quarter's sales performance. This involves pulling data from multiple sources, creating charts, analyzing trends, and writing up explanations of what happened and why. Based on similar reports I've done in the past, this takes me about 3 hours as well. And like the spreadsheet work, I really need to do this in one continuous block of time because I need to keep all the numbers and context in my head.

Here's the problem: I can't do both tasks at the same time. The spreadsheet work requires my full attention and I need to have that file open and be working in it. The report writing also requires my full attention and I need to have all those different data sources open and be writing in the document.

So I need to do these tasks one after the other, sequentially. Task A takes 3 hours, Task B takes 3 hours. That's 6 hours total.

But I only have 5 hours before the 6:00pm deadline. It's 1:00pm right now and I need both tasks done by 6:00pm.

If I start the spreadsheet task right now at 1:00pm, I'll finish at 4:00pm. Then if I start the report writing at 4:00pm, I'll finish at 7:00pm. But the deadline is 6:00pm.

Or if I do them in the other order - start the report at 1:00pm, finish at 4:00pm, then do the spreadsheet from 4:00pm to 7:00pm. Either way I'm finishing at 7:00pm and the deadline is 6:00pm.

I'm trying to figure out if there's any way to actually complete both of these tasks by the 6:00pm deadline given that they each take 3 hours and need to be done sequentially and I only have 5 hours available.

Maybe I'm missing something or maybe I need to go talk to my manager about extending the deadline or getting help, but right now I'm looking at this and it just doesn't seem mathematically possible.

Logic: QF_IDL
