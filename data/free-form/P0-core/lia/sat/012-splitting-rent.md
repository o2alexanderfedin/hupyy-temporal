# Splitting Rent Between Roommates

So me and my two roommates are moving into this apartment and the rent is $1800 a month. The thing is, the rooms are different sizes, so we don't want to just split it evenly because that wouldn't be fair.

My room is the biggest, so I'm cool with paying more. Let's call what I pay A. Sarah has the medium room, she pays B. And Jake has the smallest room, he pays C.

We figured that since my room is the biggest, I should pay at least $200 more than Sarah. And Sarah's room is bigger than Jake's, so she should pay at least $150 more than him.

Also Jake's room is pretty small, so we agreed he shouldn't pay more than $500. And obviously all three of us need to pay positive amounts.

The total rent is $1800, so A plus B plus C has to equal exactly $1800.

Can we figure out a way to split it that meets all these conditions?
