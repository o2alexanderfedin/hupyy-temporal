# Birthday Party Seating Arrangements

I'm planning my sister's birthday party and we've got 45 people confirmed coming. The venue has these round tables and I need to figure out how many to rent.

Each table can seat between 6 and 8 people comfortably. Like you could squeeze 8 but 6 is more comfortable. I don't want people crammed in but I also don't want to rent way more tables than I need because they're like $20 each to rent.

Let's say I rent T tables. Each table seats somewhere between 6 and 8 people. So the minimum total capacity is 6T and the maximum is 8T.

I need to seat all 45 people, so the total capacity has to be at least 45. But I also don't want to rent so many tables that we've got tons of empty seats because that looks weird and costs extra money.

T has to be a positive whole number because you can't rent half a table.

Can I figure out how many tables to rent?
