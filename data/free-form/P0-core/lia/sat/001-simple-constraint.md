# Simple Two-Variable Integer Constraint

Alright, so here's the deal. We've got two integer variables, let's call them x and y. The only rule is that when you add them up, the sum has to be greater than 10. That's it.

Like, x could be 5 and y could be 6, then x+y=11 which is bigger than 10. Or x=100 and y=200 gives us 300. Or x=-5 and y=20 gives us 15. Or even x=0 and y=11 works out to 11. Lots of different combinations to think about.

Both x and y are integers, so no decimals or fractions. Just whole numbers. They can be positive, negative, or zero - doesn't matter as long as their sum ends up being more than 10.

The question: can we find integer values for x and y that make this work?
