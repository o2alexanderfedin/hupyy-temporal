# Weekly Grocery Shopping Budget

Okay so I'm trying to be more responsible with my grocery spending. I've got $150 for the week and I need to divide it between different categories.

I'm thinking produce, meat, dairy, snacks, and pantry stuff like rice and pasta.

Let's call the amounts P for produce, M for meat, D for dairy, S for snacks, and N for pantry (like noodles and stuff).

I know I want to spend at least $30 on produce because that's important. Meat is expensive but I need protein, so probably at least $25 there. Dairy like milk and eggs, maybe at least $15. Snacks I want to keep under $25 because I tend to go overboard. And pantry stuff, at least $10 for basics.

All the amounts have to be positive whole numbers, no cents because I'm rounding to make the math easier. And the total of P plus M plus D plus S plus N can't go over $150 because that's all I've got in my budget.

Can I split up my $150 in a way that hits all these targets?
