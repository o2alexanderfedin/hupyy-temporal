# Concert Tickets for Friends

So there's this concert coming up and a bunch of us want to go. There are three ticket types: general admission is $45, reserved seating is $75, and VIP is $120.

We've got 8 people in the group total and we pooled our money together. We have $550 to spend on tickets.

Let's say G people get general admission, R people get reserved seating, and V people get VIP.

Obviously G plus R plus V has to equal 8 because that's how many people we have. And all the numbers have to be positive or zero, and they have to be whole numbers because you can't buy a fraction of a ticket.

The total cost is 45G plus 75R plus 120V, and that can't go over $550 because that's our budget.

Also at least 2 people want to get VIP because they're really into this band and want the meet and greet. And at least 3 people are fine with general admission because they just want to see the show and don't care about fancy seats.

Can we buy tickets for everyone and stay within budget?
