# Pizza Party Planning

So I'm throwing a party and I need to figure out the pizza situation. There's gonna be about 20 people showing up, and based on past experience, people usually eat between 2 and 3 slices each. Some people eat more, some eat less, but that's the range.

Each pizza comes with 8 slices, and they're like $15 each. I don't want to run out of food, but I also don't want to massively over-order and waste money.

Let's say I order P pizzas. That gives me 8P total slices. Each person eats somewhere between 2 and 3 slices, so total consumption is between 40 and 60 slices for the 20 people.

So I need 8P to be at least 40 to make sure everyone gets their minimum, and I also want to have enough if people are hungry, so probably closer to 60 slices total. Also P has to be a positive whole number because you can't order fractional pizzas.

Can I figure out how many pizzas to order that works?
