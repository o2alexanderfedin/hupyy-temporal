# Wedding Reception Venue Problem

So I'm helping my cousin plan her wedding reception and we've run into a problem with the guest list and the venue.

They sent out invitations to 50 people and everyone has already RSVP'd yes. So we have G guests where G equals 50.

The venue they booked looked bigger in the photos but when we went to check it out, the fire code capacity is only 30 people max. So the venue capacity C is 30.

We need all G guests to fit in the venue, which means G has to be less than or equal to C.

But we have 50 people who said they're coming and the venue only holds 30. And obviously we can't uninvite people at this point because that would be super rude.

Is there a way to fit everyone at this venue?

Logic: QF_LIA
