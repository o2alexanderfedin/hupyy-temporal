# Planning a Beach Vacation

My friends and I are trying to plan a beach vacation for spring break. We've been saving up and we have $2000 total to spend on everything.

Here's what we need to budget for:

Flights are going to cost F dollars. We looked it up and the cheapest flights we can find are $450 per person, and there's 3 of us, so F has to be at least $1350.

The hotel for the week is H dollars. We found a decent place for $800 for the whole week, so H has to be at least $800.

Then there's the rental car, which is R dollars. The cheapest option is $300 for the week, so R has to be at least $300.

And we need money for food and activities, call that E for expenses. We figure we need at least $200 for that.

So we need F plus H plus R plus E to somehow fit in our $2000 budget. But when I add up the minimums: 1350 plus 800 plus 300 plus 200, that's already $2650.

Can we make this vacation happen with the money we have?
