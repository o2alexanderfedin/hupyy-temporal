# Splitting the Dinner Bill

We went out to dinner last night, just me and Alex, and the bill came to exactly $100. Now we're trying to figure out how to split it.

Let's say I pay A dollars and Alex pays B dollars.

Obviously A plus B has to equal $100 since that's the total bill.

But here's the thing. I ordered the expensive steak and a couple cocktails, so I definitely should pay more than half. I'm thinking I should pay at least $65. So A has to be at least $65.

Alex ordered a lot too though. The appetizer, the pasta, and dessert, plus wine. So Alex is saying they should pay at least $70. So B has to be at least $70.

And obviously both of us need to pay positive amounts, so A and B both have to be greater than 0.

Can we split this bill in a way where I pay at least $65, Alex pays at least $70, and it adds up to exactly $100?
