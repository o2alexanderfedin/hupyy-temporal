# Wedding Venue Planning Nightmare

Okay so we're trying to book a wedding venue and coordinate everything. This is honestly getting complicated with all the moving parts.

Time wise, we want the ceremony between 4pm and 6pm on a Saturday in June. The ceremony takes 1 hour. Then we need the reception to start exactly 30 minutes after the ceremony ends - that gives people time to move from the ceremony space to the reception hall. The reception runs for 4 hours.

Guest count is tricky. We're inviting 150 people. The venue has a few spaces - the Garden fits up to 100 people, the Ballroom fits up to 200 people. We need spaces that actually fit our guest count.

Budget constraints are real. The Garden costs $3000 to rent. The Ballroom costs $6000. We have a total budget of $12000 for venue and catering combined. Catering costs $50 per person regardless of which space we use. So with 150 guests that's $7500 for catering alone.

Now the vendor coordination part. The venue has exclusive vendor contracts. The photographer they work with is only available for ceremonies starting before 5:30pm. The DJ is only available for receptions that end by 11pm. We need both the photographer and DJ to be available.

Plus there's the space access rules. The Garden is available to anyone. The Ballroom requires you to book their "premium package" which includes upgraded chairs and linens - that adds another $2000 to whatever your total cost is.

So you're juggling temporal constraints (ceremony 4-6pm window, 1 hour ceremony, 30 minute gap, 4 hour reception, photographer before 5:30pm start, DJ needs reception ending by 11pm), arithmetic constraints (150 guests, space capacities of 100 and 200, venue costs $3000 or $6000, catering $50 per person, premium package $2000, total budget $12000), and access rules (vendor availability, premium package requirements).

Can we book a venue setup that fits our guest count, stays within budget, accommodates the timeline, and keeps all the vendors happy?
