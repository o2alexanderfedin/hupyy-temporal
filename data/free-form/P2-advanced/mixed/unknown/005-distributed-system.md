## Problem Description

This is a gnarly one - modeling a distributed consensus protocol across 5 nodes. The nodes need to agree on a shared value, but there are all these constraints about trust levels, message timing, and communication patterns. Plus we're throwing quantifiers into the mix, which makes everything way more complex.

So we've got 5 nodes: N1, N2, N3, N4, N5. Each one has a trust level (an integer from 0 to 10). The nodes exchange messages that have timestamps, and they're all trying to commit to the same value V.

The universal properties are what make this interesting. First, there's a communication requirement: for ANY two distinct nodes i and j, at least one direction of communication must be possible - either i can send to j, or j can send to i. That's a universal quantifier ranging over all pairs of nodes.

Second, there's a consistency requirement: for ALL nodes that commit, their committed values must be identical. Another universal property.

Third, there's a trust aggregation rule: for ANY node to commit, it needs to have received messages from nodes whose trust levels add up to at least 15. So if N1 wants to commit, it might need messages from N2 (trust 4), N3 (trust 6), and N5 (trust 7) to hit 4+6+7=17, which exceeds the threshold of 15.

We're mixing multiple theories here:
- Uninterpreted functions with linear arithmetic (UFLIA) for the trust levels, communication capabilities, and value agreement - functions like trustLevel, canSend, received, value, committed
- Difference logic (IDL) for message timestamps - constraints like T_recv(i,j) - T_send(i,j) >= 0 meaning messages are received after they're sent
- Quantifiers that range over all nodes, making universal statements about communication, consistency, and trust

The interactions get complicated fast. The trust levels (integers in UFLIA) get summed up using quantified constraints - "for all j where received(i,j), sum their trust levels". The temporal constraints (IDL) must hold universally - "for all messages, receive time >= send time". The canSend function (UFLIA) appears in the universal communication property.

What makes this particularly hard is the combination of:
- Quantifiers over 5 nodes creating 5x5=25 communication pairs to check
- Trust aggregation requiring subset sums (which nodes did each node receive from?)
- Temporal causality chains as messages propagate through the network
- Consistency that must hold across all possible subsets of nodes that commit
- Interaction between network topology and trust requirements

The question: can the 5-node system reach consensus on some value V?

Here's the setup:
- trustLevel(N1) = 5, trustLevel(N2) = 4, trustLevel(N3) = 6, trustLevel(N4) = 3, trustLevel(N5) = 7
- Threshold for commitment: 15
- Messages have timestamps and delays
- Universal properties: any pair can communicate somehow, all committed values match, commitment requires sufficient trust
- For all messages: receive timestamp >= send timestamp
- Network delay bounded by some maxDelay (say 10ms)
