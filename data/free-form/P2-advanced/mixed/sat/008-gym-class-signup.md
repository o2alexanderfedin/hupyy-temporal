# Trying to Get Into That Spin Class

Alright so I'm trying to sign up for a spin class at my gym. They've got this whole complicated system for booking classes and I need to figure out if I can even get in.

Schedule wise, I can only make it to the gym between 6pm and 8pm on weekdays because of work. The spin classes they offer in that window are at 6:15pm and 7:30pm. Each class runs for 45 minutes.

Capacity is a thing too. Each spin class has exactly 20 bikes, so max 20 people per class. The 6:15pm class currently has 18 people signed up. The 7:30pm class has 12 people signed up.

Now the membership tiers determine what you can book. I've got a Basic membership. Basic members can only sign up for classes that are more than 50% empty - so if a 20-person class has more than 10 people already, Basic members are locked out. Premium members can sign up for any class as long as there's at least one spot left.

So you're mixing temporal stuff (6-8pm availability, class start times, 45-minute duration), arithmetic stuff (capacity of 20, current signup counts, the 50% threshold), and the access rules (Basic membership restrictions).

Can I sign up for a spin class that fits my schedule with my membership level and the current class capacities?

Logic: QF_IDL + QF_LIA + QF_UFLIA
