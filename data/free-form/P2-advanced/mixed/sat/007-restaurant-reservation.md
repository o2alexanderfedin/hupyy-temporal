# Getting a Table at That New Restaurant

So my partner and I are trying to get dinner at this new Italian place downtown. It's kinda fancy and has weird rules about reservations.

Timing wise, we want dinner between 7pm and 9pm. The restaurant does 90-minute seating blocks, so once you book you get the table for exactly 90 minutes. We need to start our meal somewhere in that 7-9pm window.

Party size matters too. We're bringing another couple, so that's 4 people total. The restaurant has different seating areas - the Bar Area takes parties of 2-4, the Main Dining takes parties of 2-6, and the Private Room is for parties of 8 or more.

Now here's the catch with their membership thing. They have this "Priority Members" program. Priority Members can book any seating area they want. Non-members can only book the Bar Area. My partner signed us up for Priority membership last month.

So you've got time constraints (7-9pm window, 90-minute blocks), numeric constraints (party of 4, area capacities), and access rules (membership level determines what areas you can book).

Can we get a reservation that works for our party size during our preferred time with our membership status?

Logic: QF_IDL + QF_LIA + QF_UFLIA
