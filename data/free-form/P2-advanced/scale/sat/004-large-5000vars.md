# Large Enterprise Scheduling (5000 Variables)

Okay, this is where things get serious. We're dealing with 5000 events - EV1 through EV5000 - representing a large enterprise system. These could be meetings, tasks, deadlines, milestones, all interconnected with temporal constraints.

We're looking at around 15,000 constraints connecting these events. Each event is connected to about 2-5 other events on average. So if you count both incoming and outgoing constraints, the average is around 6 connections per event - maybe 3 predecessors and 3 successors on average.

The constraint types are varied. You've got task dependencies where TaskA has to finish before TaskB can start. Meeting prerequisites where certain tasks need to be done before a meeting happens. Deadline constraints. Milestone dependencies where a milestone requires multiple tasks to be complete. Sequential meeting series that have to happen in order.

The structure is a sparse DAG. Out of the roughly 12.5 million possible connections between 5000 events, we only have about 15,000 actual constraints. So it's sparse in that sense - only about 0.12% of possible edges exist. But 15,000 constraints is still a lot to work with.

Think of it as 100 concurrent projects, each with around 50 events. Each project has its own internal dependencies - maybe 3-4 levels deep. Then there are cross-project dependencies for shared resources. Department-level milestones that require multiple projects to complete. Enterprise milestones requiring department milestones. Budget reviews depending on project status. Executive meetings depending on milestone completions.

The dependency chains can go pretty deep - maybe 50 levels from the earliest root events to the final leaf events. Some events in the middle have wide fan-out, enabling many downstream events. Others have wide fan-in, requiring many upstream events to complete first.

Can all 5000 events be scheduled such that every temporal constraint is satisfied across the entire system?
