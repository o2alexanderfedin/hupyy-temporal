# Small Wedding Table Arrangements

So my friend is getting married and there's gonna be about 50 guests at the reception. Not a huge wedding, pretty intimate actually.

The venue has round tables that seat 8 people each. So we need to figure out how many tables we need and how to arrange everything timing-wise.

For timing, there's dinner service (6:00-7:30pm), then speeches (7:30-8:00pm), then dancing starts (8:00pm onwards). Each of these has to happen after the previous one finishes.

For the tables, 50 guests divided among tables of 8. Some tables might not be completely full if the math doesn't work out perfectly. Each table needs to be set up before dinner starts.

We've also got some constraints like keeping families together, separating the divorced couple, making sure the bride's college friends are at the same table, stuff like that. But that's just relationship constraints on who sits where.

The venue has 10 tables available total, so we're definitely under the limit. Each table gets assigned a number, and each guest gets assigned to exactly one table.

Oh and there's the kids table situation - there are 6 kids under 12, and they should probably all sit together at one table so the parents can actually enjoy dinner.

Can we arrange the 50 guests at tables and schedule the evening events?

Scale: 50 guests, about 7 tables, 3 main events, 6 kids
Logic: QF_IDL + QF_LIA
