# Major Airline Daily Operations Scheduling

So this is for a major airline - think something like Delta or United - and we need to schedule all the daily operations. It's an absolutely massive operation.

We're talking about 10,000 flights per day across the entire network. Domestic flights, international flights, short hops, long hauls, everything. Each flight has a departure time, arrival time, and needs a specific aircraft assigned to it.

The airline operates out of about 200 airports, but the big hubs like Atlanta, Denver, Chicago have hundreds of flights per day each. Smaller regional airports might only have a handful.

For crew scheduling, there are roughly 15,000 flight crew members (pilots and flight attendants) who need to be assigned to these flights. Each flight needs a specific crew complement based on the aircraft type - a 737 needs 2 pilots and 4 flight attendants, a 777 needs 2 pilots and 10 flight attendants, stuff like that.

Crew members have maximum duty hours - they can only work so many hours in a row before they need rest. Federal regulations say pilots can fly max 8 hours in a 24-hour period, flight attendants can work max 14 hours. So you need to track each crew member's duty time.

At the major hub airports, there are gate constraints. Atlanta has 200 gates, but 800 flights per day, so gates need to be turned around quickly. A flight needs to be at the gate for at least 45 minutes before departure for boarding, and needs 30 minutes after arrival for deplaning. And there needs to be at least 15 minutes between when one flight leaves a gate and the next one arrives at that same gate for cleanup.

Then there's aircraft routing - the same physical airplane that does the 8am flight from Atlanta to LA needs to do the 1pm flight from LA to Seattle, then the 5pm from Seattle back to Atlanta. So you're chaining flights together and the timing has to work. Aircraft need minimum 45 minute turnaround at most airports, 60 minutes at international airports.

For passenger connections, millions of passengers are connecting between flights. If someone's flying Atlanta to LA to Tokyo, their connection time in LA needs to be at least 60 minutes for domestic connections, 90 minutes for international. We need to make sure connection times are feasible given the flight schedules.

Maintenance is another constraint - each aircraft needs to return to a maintenance hub every 72 hours for inspections. So you need to route planes through maintenance bases regularly.

There are also slot restrictions at some airports - LaGuardia and Reagan National have federal limits on how many flights can operate per hour. So you can't schedule too many flights at the same time at those airports.

Oh and crew members need to get back to their home base eventually. A pilot based in Atlanta can't just keep flying around the country indefinitely - they need to end their duty period back in Atlanta within a certain timeframe, usually within 3 days.

Weather and air traffic control can affect flight times, but for scheduling purposes we use the standard flight times. Like Atlanta to LA is always scheduled as 4 hours and 30 minutes.

Can we schedule all 10,000 daily flights with aircraft assignments, crew assignments, gate assignments, and passenger connections without violating any of the constraints?

Scale: 10,000 flights/day, 15,000 crew members, 200 airports, 200 gates at major hubs, millions of passenger connections, 72-hour aircraft maintenance cycles, duty hour limits, minimum connection times, turnaround times
