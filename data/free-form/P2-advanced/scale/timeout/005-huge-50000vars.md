# Massive Enterprise System (50,000 Variables)

So this is the big one. We're talking about 50,000 events - EV1 through EV50000 - representing a complete organizational ecosystem. This includes everything: meetings, tasks, deadlines, milestones, approvals, reviews, deliverables, dependencies across hundreds of projects and departments.

The constraint network has around 500,000 temporal ordering constraints. Each event connects to about 10-20 other events on average. That means the average event has roughly 10 predecessors it's waiting on and 10 successors waiting on it. That's an average degree of 20 connections per event.

The constraint types span the whole enterprise: hierarchical task dependencies in multi-level project structures, cross-project dependencies for shared resources, department coordination constraints, enterprise-wide milestones, approval workflow sequences, meeting scheduling with prerequisites, budget cycle dependencies, compliance and audit event ordering, product release dependencies, resource allocation constraints. All kinds of stuff.

In terms of the graph, we've got 500,000 edges out of about 1.25 billion possible connections between 50,000 events. So it's still technically sparse at 0.04% density, but 500,000 constraints is 10x denser than the 5000-event case, and the sheer number makes it complex.

The structure has depth - dependency chains can go 100-200 levels deep from root to leaf. It has width - some levels might have 5000+ events that could theoretically run in parallel. It has bottlenecks - critical milestones with 100+ incoming or outgoing constraints.

Imagine 1000 concurrent projects averaging 50 events each. Fifty departments with internal and cross-department dependencies. Multi-year strategic initiatives with quarterly milestones. Daily operational tasks and meetings. Weekly sprint cycles across development teams. Monthly review processes. Quarterly board meetings. Annual planning and budget cycles. Compliance schedules. Product development and releases. Marketing campaigns. Sales pipeline and customer commitments. All interconnected.

The search space is 50,000-dimensional. The constraint propagation involves maintaining consistency across 500,000 constraints. Memory requirements for storing and processing all those edges and nodes. Reasoning about transitive dependencies - satisfying a late-stage event means satisfying potentially hundreds or thousands of transitive prerequisites. The combination of size, density, deep chains, and complex topology creates a substantial problem.

Can all 50,000 events be scheduled such that every temporal constraint is satisfied across this massive enterprise system?
